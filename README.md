# safe-browsing-audit

OBJECTIVE:
To identify, review, and remove potentially harmful browser extensions from Chrome and Firefox, improving security and performance.

TOOLS USED:
  - Google Chrome (on Windows)
  - Mozilla Firefox (on Kali Linux)

STEPS FOLLOWED:
1. Opened the extension manager in both browsers:
   - Chrome: chrome://extensions/
   - Firefox: about:addons

2. Reviewed each installed extension:
   - Checked the permissions, source, and reviews
   - Identified trusted extensions
   - Flagged suspicious/unnecessary extensions

3. Actions Taken:
   - Kept Google Docs Offline (official & safe)
   - Removed 360 Internet Protection (privacy concerns, unnecessary)
   - Confirmed no extensions were installed on Firefox

4. Restarted browsers to apply changes and checked:
   - Speed
   - Popups/ads
   - Memory usage

EXTENSION REVIEW SUMMARY:
1. Google Docs Offline:
   - Official extension by Google
   - Minimal permissions
   - Safe and useful for working offline
   - Recommendation: Keep it

2. 360 Internet Protection:
   - Developed by Qihoo 360, a Chinese company
   - Controversial reputation (privacy concerns)
   - Requires broad access permissions
   - Removed to enhance security and performance

FIREFOX:
   - No extensions installed
   - No action needed

RESULTS AFTER CLEANUP:
   - Browser Speed: Improved — Slightly faster startup and tab switching
   - Ads/Popups: None observed — No intrusive behavior detected
   - Memory Usage: Reduced — Lighter on system resources
     
CONCLUSION:
- Successfully completed a full review and removal of suspicious extensions.
- The system is now more secure, cleaner, and efficient for daily use.
